After fighting that lasted throughout the day, the soldiers were forced to retreat. Between two and fourteen soldiers, and seven and twenty insurgents were killed during the fighting. Three army infantry combat vehicles and one lorry were destroyed, and another three armoured vehicles were captured by the insurgents.[131][132] The Internal Affairs Ministry stated that some insurgents had attempted to enter Luhansk Oblast from Russia, but had been repelled by border guards.'],

Soon after, the National Guard of Ukraine issued an ultimatum to the insurgents, which said that they should surrender immediately. This was rejected, causing paratroopers to launch an assault on the airport, accompanied by airstrikes against insurgent positions.[12][13] Attack helicopters were also used to target insurgent anti-aircraft guns.[14] Lorries with separatist reinforcements were seen heading towards the airport.[15] As evening fell, government forces pushed out the insurgents,[16] who then launched a counterattack that was repelled by government forces.[17] Sporadic gunfire was heard during the night, making it unclear if government soldiers were in full control of the airport.[16]'],

The aircraft was on approach to land at Luhansk International Airport, and was carrying troops and equipment from an undisclosed location. All 49 people on board died.']
