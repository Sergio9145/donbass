<div id="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">After <a href="" target="_blank">Euromaidan</a> protests and the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Russia annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum in which according to official results Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation. Subsequently, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in the Donbass area of Ukraine escalated into an armed conflict between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.</p></div>
