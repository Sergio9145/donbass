Eighteen soldiers were killed during an insurgent attack upon an army checkpoint near the city of Volnovakha, on 22 May.[129] Three armoured personnel carriers and several lorries were destroyed in the attack, whilst one insurgent was killed.[130] On the same day, a convoy consisting of one-hundred soldiers attempted to cross a bridge at Rubizhne, near Luhansk, and advance into insurgent-held territory.[131] They were ambushed by a group of between 300 and 500 insurgents. After fighting that lasted throughout the day, the soldiers were forced to retreat. Between two and fourteen soldiers, and seven and twenty insurgents were killed during the fighting. Three army infantry combat vehicles and one lorry were destroyed, and another three armoured vehicles were captured by the insurgents.[131][132] The Internal Affairs Ministry stated that some insurgents had attempted to enter Luhansk Oblast from Russia, but had been repelled by border guards.
