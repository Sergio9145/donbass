<p>A government military operation at the weekend of 17â€“18 January 2015 resulted in Ukrainian forces recapturing most of airport. Both sides claimed control of the airport on 19 January. During the day, insurgents blew up part of the ceiling of the first floor of the new terminal building, causing it to collapse onto holed up Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian forces attempted to surround the airport in an attempt to push back the insurgents on 20 January. As Ukrainian and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic" target="_blank">DPR</a> forces fought away from the airport, a group of insurgents stormed the ground and second floors of the new terminal building. Ukrainian troops continued to hold out on the first floor of the building until the separatists exploded the second floor at 15:30 EET, causing it to collapse onto them. This killed several soldiers, and proved to be the battle's turning point. By the next day, the remaining Ukrainian forces were either captured, killed, or were forced to withdraw from the building, allowing DPR forces to overrun it. Donetsk airport has been hold for 242 days and has become a symbol of heroism and fortitude of Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
