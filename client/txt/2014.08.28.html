<p>After days of being under siege in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ilovaisk">Ilovaisk</a>, commanders of government forces in the city attempted to negotiate an agreement that would allow them to withdraw from the city. Russian president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> said in the early morning on 29 August that a "humanitarian corridor for besieged Ukrainian soldiers" should be established, allowing the trapped soldiers to leave Ilovaisk. On 29 August at 06:00, government forces began to move out of Ilovaisk in a column of sixty vehicles. At the same time the Russian commanders attempted to change the terms of the agreement, suggesting a new route out of Ilovaisk, demanding that Ukrainian forces surrender all weaponry, and that they leave behind the volunteer battalions. Lt. General Ruslan Khomchak, commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ilovaisk, replied that his troops would leave as agreed previously, and ordered them "to march in full battle readiness". The first lorry in the column, carrying dead and wounded soldiers, was flying a white flag. The Northern column advanced 10 kilometres along the corridor, about an hour's drive, but was then surrounded by Russian and insurgent troops. Near the Krasnaya Polyana valley Russian troops opened fire on the Northern column with mortars and heavy machine guns, splitting it into two. One fleeing Ukrainian soldier later described the situation as "a real meat grinder". The Ukrainian government described the events as a "massacre". Official verision says said that, in total, more than 500 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner by pro-Russian forces. The number of casualties is more than 360.</p>
