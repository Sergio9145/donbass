<p>From mid-January 2015 the separatist forces of the Donetsk People's Republic tried to recapture the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Debaltseve">Debaltseve</a> in Donetsk Oblast, which had been under Ukrainian control since a counter-offensive by government forces in July 2014. The city lay in a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salient_(military)">wedge</a>" of Ukrainian-held territory bordered by the DPR on one side, and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) on the other, and is a vital road and railway junction. Separatists began a concerted effort to force Ukrainian troops out of the city on 16â€“17 January, sparking the Battle of Debaltseve. Heavy fighting went on until 18 February 2015, when Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw.</p>
