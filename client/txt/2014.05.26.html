During the morning of 26 May, pro-Russian separatist insurgents captured the terminal buildings of Donetsk International Airport, and demanded the withdrawal of government forces from the area.[11][7] The militants also blocked off the road to the airport. Soon after, the National Guard of Ukraine issued an ultimatum to the insurgents, which said that they should surrender immediately. This was rejected, causing paratroopers to launch an assault on the airport, accompanied by airstrikes against insurgent positions.[12][13] Attack helicopters were also used to target insurgent anti-aircraft guns.[14] Lorries with separatist reinforcements were seen heading towards the airport.[15] As evening fell, government forces pushed out the insurgents,[16] who then launched a counterattack that was repelled by government forces.[17] Sporadic gunfire was heard during the night, making it unclear if government soldiers were in full control of the airport.[16]
